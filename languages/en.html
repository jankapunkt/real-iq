    <!-- TEST INTRO =========================================================

        We use this component to make the user think, there is some real test
        going on and distract from the fact, the modal will be the test.
        Therefore we need at least texts that make some kind of sense and
        introduce some kind of test.

                This test is intended to provide a fast, intuitive and practical
                way to measure the general IQ of a person. While there are many
                IQ tests out there, claiming to assess general IQ, we believe
                them to be impractical and too isolated from a real-world
                perspective.
                We therefore invented the REAL-IQ test in order to show that IQ.

            </div>

            <p class="text-justify">
                If you are interested in how this test works you are free to
                continue, it won't affect the outcome of the test. We
                can assume, that if you already reached this section you are
                reading careful enough to also read the prompt messages of the
                test.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                We will prompt you a modal in exactly 3 seconds, so you might
                not be able to read this passage. We will fake a typical
                cookie-consent
                prompt, asking you to either "accept all" or "manage settings".
                Accepting all leads to a zero score and you can consider
                yourself
                ignorant and cognitive mediocre. If you, however manage settings
                you
                will be rewarded points for each tracking option you disable.
                The more you disable (including hidden options), the higher your
                score.

                the
                users has "accepted all" tracking) can be considered to reflect
                some

                        <p>
                            We found that simply collecting everything without a
                            clear purpose will result in high legal penalties.
                            Some
                            of our smartest people invented a solution for this
                            problem: legitimate interest. We simply define the
                            most
                            basic data we need to make profits and declare them
                            as
                            legitimate interest. So even if you deny all consent
                            you
                            still have to actively deny legitimate interest.
                            Most
                            users are too lazy to do that so
