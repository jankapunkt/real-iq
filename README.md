| **Spoiler alert** |
| ----------------- |
| It simulates a cookie consent form and gathers a score from the managed  settings. The score will be higher, the more the person disabled.
After saving the results will also add info about what is tracked and suggestions about better privacy. If the person simply accepted all it will additionally add an insulting message. | 

## How it's built

It's actually built using html5 + vanilla js + css (with Bootstrap 5 default theme).

No bundlers, frameworks or tools like jQuery. Just standards.
